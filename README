A bot that saves links, starting with http/https, to bitly.

It can be added by you and your friends. 
Whenever it gets a message from someone other than the super user, it forwards it to the super user.

If you define a bundle in the settings file, all the links will be saved to
that bundle.

This project uses PygtalkRobot, an open source python gtalk bot framework 
using XMPPPY library: http://code.google.com/p/pygtalkrobot/
