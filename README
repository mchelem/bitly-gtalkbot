A bot that saves links, starting with http/https, to bitly.

Run it using your email address as the superuser, and your bitly access token.
Then, the bot can be added by you and your friends. Whenever someone sends a message, it will be forwarded to you.

If you define a bundle in the settings file, all the links will be saved to
that bundle.

I use it as a very practical way to exchange links between computers (gtalk opens a window automatically), 
while saving the links to bitly.

This project uses PygtalkRobot, an open source python gtalk bot framework 
using XMPPPY library: http://code.google.com/p/pygtalkrobot/
